// Ownership rules:
// - Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// - There can only be one owner at a time.
// - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

// Reference rules:
// - At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
// - References must always be valid.
